/**
 * FUMS is the Fair Use Management System. It's a system that we ask all API developers to use as a
 * way to help us ensure that the API contents are being used fairly. It also allows us to profile
 * usage of the various versions, books, chapters, and verses that are requested from the API, so
 * that we can communicate the value of API-accessible Scripture texts back to copyright holders and
 * publishers. You can read more background on why the FUMS exists in the API Introduction.
